A simple text search program that accepts a path to a directory and provides a prompt
where you can enter queries on the documents in that directory. 
Queries begin with 'AND' or 'OR' so:
entry query> AND cats dogs
entry query> OR birds zebras
And the output is the list of the paths to files containing either all the terms (AND) or any of the terms (OR)
