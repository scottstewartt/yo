(This was a coding problem for an interview. I was given 3 hours to complete it.)

A simple text search program that accepts a path to a directory and provides a prompt where you can enter queries on the documents in that directory. 

Queries begin with 'AND' or 'OR' so:<br/>
entry query> AND cats dogs<br/>
entry query> OR birds zebras

And the output is the list of the paths to files containing either all the terms (AND) or any of the terms (OR)
